Static binaries of FFmpeg, for multiple OS &amp; CPU combinations, built from
source in a GitHub Actions workflow.

# How are they built?

FFmpeg and its key dependencies are all built from source and linked statically.
Each run of the GitHub Actions workflow logs the MD5 sums of the binaries, and
it places the MD5 sums into the release notes.  You can see how they were built,
and you can verify that they haven't been tampered with.  The sums in the
workflow logs, release notes, and the binaries should all match.
You can read the details in the [workflow source][workflow].

No third-party GitHub Actions have been used in this workflow, to protect
against supply-chain attacks.


# Triggering a build

Update the version numbers as needed in the [version file][version-file], then
create a tag on the new commit.  Full builds will be triggered, and binaries
will be attached to a release on the new tag.


# Tag names

Tag names should follow the form of `$FFMPEG_VERSION-$WORKFLOW_RELEASE_NUMBER`.
For example, the first time we release a build based on FFmpeg n4.4, the tag
should be "n4.4-1".  If we need to update the dependencies, or change the
configuration, or make any other changes to the workflow that don't change the
FFmpeg version, the next release would be "n4.4-2".  When FFmpeg n4.5 is
released upstream, we could update to that and then tag "n4.5-1".
