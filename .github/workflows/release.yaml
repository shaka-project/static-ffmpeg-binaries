# A workflow to build and release fresh binaries.

# Runs when a new tag is created.  Creates a release for that tag, then builds
# ffmpeg and ffprobe on all OS & CPU combinations, then attaches them to the
# release.

# NOTE: The versions of the software we build are stored in versions.txt.

# By default, run all commands in a bash shell.  On Windows, the default would
# otherwise be powershell.  Each shell command should begin with "set -e" (to
# make any failed command fail the script immediately) and "set -x" (to log
# what commands are being run).
defaults:

  # On a single Linux host, draft a release.  Later, different hosts will build
