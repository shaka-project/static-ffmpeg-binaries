# A workflow test PRs by building fresh binaries.
name: Test

# Runs when a PR is uploaded or revised.  Builds ffmpeg and ffprobe on all OS &
# CPU combinations.  Uses pull_request_target rather than pull_request for
# access to configuration variables.  Since no secrets are accessed or passed
# to the build workflow, this is safe.  Only the release workflow uses secrets.
on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

# If another instance of this workflow is started for the same PR, cancel the
# old one.  If a PR is updated and a new test run is started, the old test run
# will be cancelled automatically to conserve resources.
concurrency:

# NOTE: Set the repository variable ENABLE_DEBUG to enable debugging via tmate
# on failure.
# NOTE: Set the repository variable ENABLE_SELF_HOSTED to enable self-hosted
# runners such as linux-arm64.  This is set on the official repo, but forks
# will have to opt in after setting up their own self-hosted runners.
